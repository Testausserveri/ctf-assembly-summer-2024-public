## Solution

The file was located at https://antti.codes/assyt-on-rakkaus-assyt-on-elama.html

The intended solution was something like

- `"TSRY" "assembly"`
- `"testausserveri" "assembly"`

but apparently google indexing of the site changed mid-competition...

What worked instead was OSINTing the creator of the challenge and 

- `"TSRY" site:antti.codes`
